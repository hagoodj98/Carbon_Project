          <p>The Texas town edged out notoriously toxic Los Angeles for the crown of America's biggest polluter. Offering his take on how Houston produced 18 million tons of carbon dioxide is Houston Chronicle writer Tim Fleck. "He was sort of a must-read and always the source of regular conversation," said U.S. Rep. Chris Bell, who first met Fleck when both were reporters for KTRH radio in the late 1980s. "I've had good, bad and indifferent stories written about me by Tim, but my sense was, most people didn't take it personally whenever they might have gotten stung in one of his stories."</p>
          <br />
          <p>Fleck, a Houston native who graduated from the University of Houston, has been around the local journalism scene for decades, specializing in political and investigative reporting. He joined the Press when it was founded in 1989. He left in 1993, returning in August 1994, after it was purchased by New Times, a Phoenix-based chain of alternative weeklies. In between, Fleck had published a political newsletter, the Houston Insider, and he began a weekly column, The Insider, in addition to handling other writing responsibilities at the Press. The Insider was filled with acerbic wit, including this take on Anthony Hall, just named as Mayor Bill White's chief administrative officer. "After the Insider congratulated Hall for his survivability, Hall responded somewhat defensively that he could have gone into the private sector and made millions of dollars. There are those who might have been willing to pay him more than that to leave."</p>

          <p>MIKE PESCA, host:</p>
          <br />
          <p>Well, Harris County, you can distribute the foam fingers and book a parade, you're number one! Unfortunately, the category is "emitter of greenhouse gases." It is the first ever county-by-county assessment of carbon dioxide emissions. Harris County, the home county of Houston, Texas, came out on top. </p>
          <br />
          <p>So, let's hope the parade floats are pulled by Priuses. But, you know, it's easy to put fingers, foam or otherwise, but Harris County is an engine of sorts for the rest of Texas and America, and at the same time, 18 million tons of CO2 is a lot. Tim Fleck is an editorial writer for the Houston Chronicle. He is with us from his home in Harris County. Hello, Tim. </p>
          <br />
          <p>Mr. TIM FLECK (Editorial Writer, Houston Chronicle): Good morning, Mike.</p>
          <br />
          <p>PESCA: Tim, have you lived in Houston a long time?</p>

          <p>Mr. FLECK: I was born here.</p>
          <br />
          <p>PESCA: OK. So you remember, let me bring you back to a time called 1983. The Houston Cougars basketball team had formed Phi Slama Jama, and they were number one in the polls. Was it a different feeling when they were named number one than when you were named number one as a CO2 emitter?</p>
          <br />
          <p>Mr. FLECK: Well, yes. Unfortunately, I have to back to '83, when we also got beat by North Carolina in the finals.</p>
          <br />
          <p>PESCA: OK. That was an upset.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Mr. FLECK: Consider, we're just barely ahead of the Los Angeles area. I mean, 18.6 to 18.5, so we're right up there with L.A.</p>
          <br />
          <p>PESCA: Right, you could say that to yourself, but really, how are Houstonians reacting? Are they kind of emphasizing that they're just barely number one or has there been any soul searching going on?</p>

      <section>
        <article class="articles">
          <p>Mr. FLECK: Well, I don't think there's much surprise here, and I think what the message is here is industry is a far more potent emitter of greenhouse gas than people. You look at L.A., which - Los Angeles County has 9.8 million people. We have only 3.9 million people. That's two and a half times as many people, but we have one of the world's largest petrochemical complexes.</p>
          <br />
          <p>We have a 50-mile ship channel that brings in the largest foreign tonnage of any port in the United States. And those foreign ships have some very dirty engines. So I think what the point is here is that people can do everything possible to try to lower their CO2 footprint, but industry is just a far bigger factor. And that's why we emit more.</p>
          <br />
          <p>PESCA: So does everyone or most people in Houston just chalk it up to the price of doing business?</p>
          <br />
          <p>Mr. FLECK: I think so. We don't like it, certainly. And I think there's a large progressive faction in Houston, including, increasingly, corporate CEOs, who want to put Houston in the forefront of creating renewable energy, becoming, perhaps, a carbon-trading hub once the carbon-trading cap-and-trade system goes into effect, as it undoubtedly will in the next few years. So while we're looking at it as this is the price of doing business, I think a lot of us realize business has got to change.</p>

          <p>PESCA: Right. Because you're - because you talked about what we could we do from a personal level, but are there any movements afoot to change laws? Sometimes even a city will change a law that affects a huge multi-national corporation doing business inside the city. Or are the Houstonians more hands-off? Like, why would you want to mess around with one of these big petrochemical companies who provide jobs and money for the local area?</p>
          <br />
          <p>Mr. FLECK: Well, historically, Texas, and Houston, has been pro-industry.</p>
          <br />
          <p>PESCA: Yes.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Mr. FLECK: Historically, the Texas Legislature has given big industry everything it wants. I think that the prevalent point of view was that industry is good for us. Let them regulate themselves. They'll do what's best. Well, that's changing. We have a mayor, Bill White, new administration, not so new now, actually he's on his third term.</p>
          <br />
          <p>But he's pushed hard for tougher air pollution standards. The city, in fact, has tried to take it into its own hands by enforcing nuisance ordinances against big polluters. The city fleet has gone hybrid. We're considering an ordinance right now down at city hall to force developers to build green buildings with - to environmental standards.</p>
